## 💀 Skeleton Crew: Versatile Foundation

### 🏗️ Our Reusable Skeleton Framework

The `Skeleton` directory contains our production-ready template featuring:

**Backend Foundation:**
- **Abstract router template** with 3 customizable methods for AI behavior
- **Base configuration system** that apps extend with their own settings  
- **Gemini AI client** with error handling and response parsing
- **Common Pydantic models** (FlowStep, FlowOption, etc.) shared across apps
- **Utility functions** for JSON parsing, validation, and data sanitization
- **FastAPI app factory** with CORS middleware and health checks

**Frontend Foundation:**
- **Base API service classes** with timeout handling and error management
- **React hooks** for common API interactions and state management
- **TypeScript interfaces** matching backend models
- **TailwindCSS configuration** with extensible themes
- **Deployment configurations** ready for Railway + Netlify

### 🎯 Two Production Applications Built From One Skeleton

#### 🧠 [Logic Hinter](https://app1kiro.netlify.app/) - The Brainstorm Coding Buddy that doesn't give code

**The Problem:** Stuck on a LeetCode problem? Don't want to see the solution directly and ruin your learning? YouTube tutorials show you the code, AI chat gives you the answer, but nobody allows YOU to think through a problem?

**Our Solution:** Logic Hinter is the world's first AI that **NEVER GIVES CODE** - only guides your reasoning. A patient mentor who helps you think step-by-step, not copy.

**Why It's Revolutionary:**
- 💡 **Pure Logic Training** - Builds algorithmic code thinking, not copy-paste habits.
- 🔗 **Smart Learning Links** - Provides curated educational resources but never direct code solutions.
- � **Earn Your Resources** - Get helpful learning resources only AFTER making the right reasoning choice.
- 🎯 **Two Learning Modes** - "Naive" (explore basics) and "Optimized" (efficiency-focused)

**Perfect For:** Developers who want to actually understand algorithms, not just memorize solutions.

#### 📚 [Study Hinter](https://app2kiro.netlify.app/) - Interactive General Knowledge for Kids

An intelligent General Knowledge companion for children that generates quiz questions and provides adaptive "mistake-based" learning guidance. Transform any topic into an engaging learning experience.

**Key Features:**
- 🧠 **AI-Generated Questions** - Custom quizzes for any topic
- 📊 **Adaptive Difficulty** - Below Grade 6 vs Above Grade 6 modes
- ⭐ **Star-Based Scoring** - Mistake-based learning (4→3→2→1 stars per wrong option selection)
- 🖼️ **Visual Learning** - Images for each answer option via Unsplash integration for children.
- 🎃 **Spooky Theme** - Engaging Halloween-inspired design

### 🌟 Skeleton - Endless Possibilities

Our foundation of "option-based" learning can power diverse AI applications:

- 🎮 **Interactive Adventure Games** - Choose-your-own-adventure with consequences
- 🏥 **Medical Training Platforms** - Diagnostic reasoning for healthcare professionals  
- 🌍 **Language Learning Apps** - Conversation scenarios and cultural context
- 💼 **Professional Development** - Workplace skills and decision-making frameworks
- 🧮 **Educational Tools** - Math, science, and academic subject tutoring
- 🎯 **Skill Assessment** - Interactive evaluations and personalized feedback

## 🧟 Frankenstein: Technology Chimera

**The Challenge:** Stitch together a chimera of technologies into one app. Bring together seemingly incompatible elements to build something unexpectedly powerful.

**Our Creation:** We've merged Python FastAPI backends with React/TypeScript frontends, integrated Gemini's models with custom logic engines, and combined real-time AI processing with polished UI/UX. The result? Two distinct applications that seamlessly blend:
- 🐍 Python + FastAPI (Backend)
- ⚛️ React + TypeScript/JSX (Frontend)
- 🤖 Gemini (AI Intelligence)
- 🎨 TailwindCSS + Custom Animations (Spooky UI)
- ☁️ Railway + Netlify (Cloud Deployment)

## 👻 Costume Contest: Haunting UI/UX

**The Challenge:** Build any app but show us a haunting user interface that's polished and unforgettable. Bring in spooky design elements that enhance your app's function.

**Our Spooky Design Elements:**
- 🌙 Dark, atmospheric color schemes (purple for Logic, green for Study)
- ✨ Smooth fade-in animations and transitions
- 🕸️ Glowing effects and shadow layers
- 💀 Themed emoji and iconography
- 🎭 Polished, professional layouts with Halloween flair
- 🌫️ Gradient backgrounds that evoke mystery

Both applications feature carefully crafted interfaces that don't just look spooky—they enhance usability through thoughtful design choices, smooth interactions, and clear visual hierarchy.

## 🎯 What Makes This Special

1. **True Versatility:** One skeleton, two completely different applications with distinct purposes
2. **AI-Powered:** Leveraging Gemini for intelligent, context-aware responses
3. **Production-Ready:** Deployed and accessible with proper CI/CD pipelines
4. **Design Excellence:** Spooky aesthetics that enhance rather than distract
5. **Clean Code:** Modular, maintainable, and well-documented

## 🧪 Local Development

Each application can be run independently:

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd app1-LogicHinter/backend  # or app2-StudyHinter/backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd app1-LogicHinter/frontend  # or app2-StudyHinter/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
